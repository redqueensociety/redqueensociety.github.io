<body>

  <p> As a fellow of the Red Queen Society, we'll sponsor your reading habits. Any book or magazine you read will be paid for! No strings attached.

  <p>To apply, please email <a href="mailto:hello@redqueensociety.org">hello@redqueensociety.org</a> with answers to the following questions. Feel free to get creative!

  <p>Don’t worry, these answers will be kept secret (read by our founders then permanently deleted) and you will not offend anyone, e.g. by listing “controversial” titles like <em>Das Kapital</em> or <em>The Bell Curve</em>.

  <ul>
    <li>Please list your interests and questions you often think about. Examples <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/questions">here</a> and <a href="https://guzey.com/personal/research-ideas/">here</a>.
    <li>What books do you want to buy?
    <li>What have you built?
    <li>If you could start a populist movement, what are some ideas you’d rally around?
    <li>Do you have a Straussian reading of any well-known literature?
    <li>What radical policy ideas are you interested in?
    <li>Who are the smartest people you personally know?
  </ul>

  <p>Thanks! We’ll review applications and get back to you.

  <p>You'll get 2 years as a part of the fellowship, though we’ll increase that to 3 years if you share this application on your main social media platform or send this link (redqueensociety.org/apply) to 5 or more friends within one week of applying. Who wouldn't love the chance for free books!
