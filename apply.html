  <p>Ideas are more accessible and prolific than ever. Great individuals don’t need to look far to find interesting ideas.

  <p>But human infrastructure doesn’t scale in the same way that information infrastructure does. For every one person you could do something meaningful with, there are one thousand whom you could simply meet. That’s why everything people-related should be done through networks. Traditional selection mechanisms regress towards the mean and can’t quantify the qualitative.

  <p>History is littered with examples. PayPal was started by a small group of exceptional entrepreneurs who went on to do great things. Likewise, the physicists at the Manhattan project produced incredibly impactful work through an unsually high concentration of (carefully-selected) talent.

  <p>Organizations like The Stanford Review take a hybrid approach: they built an internal culture committed to free ideas and alternative perspectives, and distribute commentary to the external world. While many assume that the publication is the product, we see it differently. A student-run newspaper will seldom change anyone’s mind, but the bonds created within The Review’s walls have helped members build lasting institutions like Palantir.

  <p>The Red Queen Society is building a similar infrastructure for the next-generation of curious thinkers and builders.

  <p>We have a love for both mainstream and heterodox ideas. We also have a visceral disgust towards single-mindedness.

  <p>Our community is starting out with one humble goal: free access to any book you want to read. Removing the cost of exploring your most expansive and obscure interests will benefit you as well as everyone around you.

  <p>But this perk is not the reason to be a part of it.

  <p>Through the Red Queen Society, you’ll befriend a small number of the most original and ambitious people we can find. If the idea of a closed community dedicated to spreading alternative perspectives makes you ecstatic, please <a href="mailto:hello@redqueensociety.org">get in touch</a> today.

  <p>Learn more about us <a href="redqueensociety.org/about">here</a>, and apply to our fellowship <a href="http://redqueensociety.org/apply">here</a>.
