  <h1>Red Queen Society</h1>
  
<p class="a"> Today, curious and ambitious young people end up in universities surrounded by academic groupthink and career oriented hyper-tracked peers. <br/>

The Red Queen Society is an intellectual alternative that empowers individuals to think freely, read widely, and connect with other ambitious and original thinkers. <br/>

Ideas are more accessible and prolific than ever. But ideas need human infrastructure to manifest and talented networks of people simply do not scale the same way information does. <br/>

History is littered with examples of inspired groups of people who were committed to exploring and manifesting heterodox ideas about the world. The American Founding Fathers, the Fifth Solvay Conference, Rotary International, the PayPal Mafia, the Barons of England, the Apostles, Plato's Academy… <br/>

While many assume that the product of these organizations is their output, we see it differently. The people are the product, and the true value comes from long term relationships built within. <br/>

Red Queen Society is building an infrastructure for the next-generation of curious thinkers and builders. <br/>

We're seeding our community with one humble goal: free access to any book you want to read. <br/>

Through the Red Queen Society, you’ll befriend a small number of the most original and ambitious people we can find. If the idea of a closed community dedicated to spreading alternative perspectives makes you ecstatic, please <a href="mailto:hello@redqueensociety.org">get in touch</a> today. </p>
